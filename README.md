# CPSC 355 - Computing Machinery I
These are my assignments for CPSC 355 @ Winter 2024, taught by Leonard Manzara.
# Contents
Each folder contains a .pdf document with the instructions, along with my submissions of course.

Anyway, here's a short description of each assignment at a quick glance.
- Assignment 1: Find the minimum value of *(y = 3x^3 + 31x^2 - 15x - 127)* with a given range *(-10 <= x <= 4)*.
- Assignment 2: Given C code for an integer multiplication program, implement it in ARMv8.
- Assignment 3: Given C code for an **Insertion sort** algorithm, implement it in ARMv8.
- Assignment 4: Given C code with multiple subroutines/structures, implement it in ARMv8. (**Cuboid**)
- Assignment 5: Given C code implementing a **Queue** data structure using an array, translate it to ARMv8.
- Assignment 6: Write an ARMv8 program to compute the functions *e^x* and *e^-x* using series expansions.
# Assignment Grades
- Assignment 1: 100%
- Assignment 2: 98%  (used too many unnecessary jumps)
- Assignment 3: 90%  (sorted array is backwards, and no script)
- Assignment 4: 97%  (not using multiple printf calls in printCuboid)
- Assignment 5: 100%
- Assignment 6: 100%
